/* The disc panel's Serial row and the reason line under it (PS1B-403).
 *
 * A player gave a build made for SLES-03396 a disc of another release,
 * SLES-03398. The panel showed "Serial  SLES-03398" with a tick, and the only
 * sentence on it was the online-play note about the TOC fingerprint. He could
 * not tell that he had the wrong release.
 *
 * The contract tested here, at the model:
 *
 *   - the Serial row is a tick only for a serial that was read and that the
 *     host did not call unlisted;
 *   - for an unlisted serial the line under the checklist names the disc's
 *     serial and what the build needs, and the online-play note is not shown;
 *   - a host that does not say whether the serial is listed gets the old rows.
 *
 * Includes the model translation unit to reach the static run_verify(), which
 * is what copies the host's answer into the model.
