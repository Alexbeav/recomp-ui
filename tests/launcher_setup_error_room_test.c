/* The setup wizard's error text holds a host's whole sentence (PS1G-63).
 *
 * A setup host tells the player why a disc is refused: which disc image the
 * kit was made from, which file was selected, and what it may be. With the
 * host's prefix that sentence runs to about 480 bytes. The wizard's text and
 * the job buffer the host writes into held 255, so the sentence was cut in
 * the middle of the selected file's name or size, and its last sentence was
 * never shown.
 *
 * Includes the model translation unit to run the prepare job's own code: the
 * thread function that calls the host, and the poll that moves the host's
 * reason into the wizard.
