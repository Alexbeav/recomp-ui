"""The launcher offers OpenBIOS only in a build that holds it (PS1B-420).

Every PlayStation kit's setup window called the BIOS optional and offered
"Use OpenBIOS" in five places. A build that holds no BIOS of its own (every
pin H kit) needs the player's image; the button cleared the BIOS they had
chosen and switched to nothing. Alex decided the words for such a build on
2026-10-02 (A16).

Which kind of build it is, is decided in the model and tested there
(launcher_model_bundled_bios_offered, tests/launcher_bios_step_test.c). This
test keeps the view to that decision and to the accepted words:

  - every "Use OpenBIOS" button is inside a condition on the model's answer;
  - the heading and the line of step 1 have both forms, chosen by it;
  - the picker's title names no file (it named SCPH1001.BIN for every kit);
  - Generate waits for a BIOS, with the accepted tooltip.
