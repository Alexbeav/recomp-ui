/* The disc panel follows a file that setup refused (PS1B-415).
 *
 * In a kit's setup window two checks judge the selected disc. The disc panel
 * asks the game program (header and serial). "Generate & rebuild" asks setup,
 * which compares the disc with the kit and can refuse it. Nothing connected
 * them: a first pressing with the kit's serial showed "Disc verified" in the
 * panel and "Disc verification failed: ..." under it.
 *
 * The setup host now answers "bad" for the file it refused. The model's half,
 * tested here:
 *
 *   - after a failed prepare the disc check runs again, so the panel takes the
 *     host's new answer without the player touching the file;
 *   - a failure that is not a refusal of the file leaves "Disc verified";
 *   - another file, and a prepare that succeeds, end it;
 *   - Generate can be started again for the refused file (the player replaced
 *     it in place);
 *   - launcher_model_disc_refused_by_setup() is true only while the "bad" is
 *     setup's, for a panel row that says so.
 *
 * The host below stands in for the setup host of the framework
 * (host/psxrecomp_codegen_host.c, host/psx_setup_refusal.h): it remembers one
 * refused file, forgets it on a success and on a check of another file.
 *
 * Includes the model translation unit to reach the prepare job.
