/* The BIOS step of the setup window in a build that holds no BIOS of its own
 * (PS1B-420).
 *
 * Every PlayStation kit's setup window said "1. PlayStation BIOS (optional)",
 * "OpenBIOS is used unless you browse for a retail dump", and offered "Use
 * OpenBIOS". The pin H kits hold no OpenBIOS: the button cleared the BIOS the
 * player had chosen and switched to nothing, and Generate could be pressed
 * with no BIOS and ended in a command-line hint.
 *
 * The launcher learns which kind of build it is from an answer it already
 * asks for: the host's verdict on an EMPTY BIOS path. Tested here, at the
 * model:
 *
 *   - launcher_model_bundled_bios_offered: yes for a build that accepts the
 *     empty path, no for one that refuses it, whatever BIOS is chosen;
 *   - launcher_model_setup_bios_blocks_generate: Generate waits for a usable
 *     BIOS in a build that holds none, and only there.
 *
 * Includes the model translation unit (as the other model tests do).
