/* Dashboard player tabs: how many tabs a title gets, and which one is open.
 *
 * The controller cards of a title stood side by side. With four players the
 * second row of cards did not fit above the memory cards: "PLAYER 4" was cut
 * off and the section scrolled. The PSX profile now asks for one tab per
 * player (ControllerSpec.player_tabs) with one card under the strip.
 *
 * The tab count is the number of cards the launcher drew before
 * (launcher_model_visible_player_count): the players the title declares, and
 * two for a title of three or more until Multitap is on. A one-player title
 * gets no strip.
 *
 * Includes the model translation unit, as launcher_pad_mode_test.c does.
